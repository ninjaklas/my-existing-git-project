Do not place modules directly in this directory (sites/all/modules).

Instead, place: (ignore this parenthesis):

contributed modules (from drupal.org) in "sites/all/modules/contrib",
custom modules in "sites/all/modules/custom" and
feature modules (created with the features module) in "sites/all/modules/features".
